# wf_mapper
This is a project made for a web-game called Warring Factions (www.war-facts.com).

The game allows players to deploy sensors which can report on enemy ship locations but only shows the results to the owner of the sensor net and only in real time.

This program logs into the user's account, extrapolates the enemy ship results, and stores the data in an SQL database.

This program also maps the name, size, weight, and last 12 hours of enemy fleets.

This was the first project for PHP, SQL, and Python I've ever made.
